Kyle: Hi, this is Kyle, and I'm doing an interview with Chloe Wong. Chloe, can you introduce yourself?
Chloe: I'm Chloe. I'm Kyle's best friend. Nice to meet you.
Kyle: So today I wanted to ask you about why you decided to cut your hair short.
Chloe: Oh, that's such a good question. Yeah. When I came to Seattle, my hair was super long and curly. But then I got really big into dancing, so it gives me a lot of trouble to keep my hair tidy and all tied up while dancing. So for the sake of dancing easily and cleaning it easily, I cut it short. And I really like it.
Kyle: I think that I might want to cut my hair short now. How do you feel about that?
Chloe: I think your hair is not too long. Why do you want to cut your hair shorter?
Kyle: Because I think that people think my hair looks stupid.
Chloe: Really? Who are the people? We need to educate them to learn to love your hair. Okay.
Kyle: Right. I think you're right. Yeah.
